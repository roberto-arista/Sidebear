# Sidebear

![](./_images/Sidebear_Icon.png)
<br />
Robofont extension for manipulating your glyph’s sidebearings. 
<br />
Sidebear installs itself in your Inspector, underneath the Glyph Info pane.
<br />
<br />

## Actions include:
`Enter Desired SB` You may enter numerical values or glyph names. If you place a comma `,` before or after the glyph name, the opposite SB will be matched. (For example, `,n` input on the LSB of glyph `u`  will match the RSB of the `n`.)
<br />
`Swap SBs`
<br /><br />
`Make LSB = RSB`
<br />
`Center glyph` Make SBs equal (Set width may change ± 1)
<br />
`Make RSB = LSB`

##### Choose an increment, then:
`Contract both SBs` equally by that increment.
<br />
`Expand both SBs` equally by that increment.
